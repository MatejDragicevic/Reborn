# LC PRACTICE PROJECT

I started this repo to share my leetcode solutions.
As I got into it, I realized that is of no use, since LeetCode registers each of your submits.
I have decided to use this as a reminder Repo for future reference.

## Info
The old readme can be found [here](/archive/oldREADME.md).
In this repo you can find my previous Java Solutions until 08.07.2022.
From that day I did not submit Solutions to this repo.
The solutions are found in the leetcodeJava directory.
Instead I concentrated on making it a study ground for [datastructure](/DS/dataStructure.md).
In the near future I will dive a bit more into [Algorithms](/algorithms/algorithms.md)
