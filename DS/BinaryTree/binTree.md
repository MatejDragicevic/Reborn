## Intro
- ***TREE***
    - simulate hierarchical tree structure
    - each node has a root value
    - each node has a list of references to other nodes(child nodes)
    - directed acyclic graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges
- ***BINARY TREE***
    - each node has at most two children(left and right)
